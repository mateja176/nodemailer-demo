<p>You&#39;re an extremely good <strong>storyteller</strong>. No wonder you have attracted such a large following on <strong>YouTube</strong>, by creating compelling stories which people want to see and hear.</p>
<p>Apart from the quality narration, your videos own their success to awe-inspiring visualizations. By telling your stories in such a way, people simply want to <strong>watch more</strong> of your videos and they want to <strong>watch them for longer</strong>.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve experienced this myself... You are probably using a software similar to <strong>VideoScribe</strong>. I remember when I created my first video in VideoScribe and put it on YouTube. With little to no experience in video editing and, frankly, terrible audio, I created a video which was watched around <strong>half a million</strong> times in the first couple of months. With just 2 videos I amassed a following of circa <strong>10.000 subscribers</strong>. It was perhaps the first time in my life that people carefully listened to what I had to say. The feeling was incredible.</p>
<p>However, I also experienced a number of downsides while using VideoScribe. The app would <strong>frequently crash</strong> while I was using it on my laptop (which was the sole computer I owned at the time) and the software is <strong>not cheap</strong> either. Apart from that video rendering took an <strong>awfully long time</strong> and when I switched to a Linux operating system I couldn&#39;t use VideoScribe at all since it only supports Windows and MacOS machines. On top of that, there was <strong>no way to quickly share your story</strong> with others, since you&#39;d first have to render the video and upload it somewhere. Let alone if you wanted to make an update to the video, you&#39;d have to go through the whole process again.</p>
<p>Fast forward a couple of years, I became a professional web developer and I still loved the gist of VideoScribe and the way it empowers storytellers. So I decided to create a VideoScribe inspired application which would <strong>address all of the issues</strong> which were mentioned above.</p>
<p>The app is called <a href="https://video-storyteller-dev.web.app">Video Storyteller</a> and it&#39;s currently in closed <strong>beta version</strong>. I hand picked a number of individuals to gain access to the platform and use all of the currently available features for <strong>free</strong>, no strings attached. Although, it would help out the development of the product greatly if you provided <strong>feedback</strong> on using the app by filling out this <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/6G5GKTG">5 question survey</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, since I&#39;m currently alone in the venture I&#39;m open to <strong>sharing a piece of the cake</strong> with someone who shares my vision of empowering people around their world to share their stories with others. You can access the app <strong>directly in your browser</strong> by visiting <a href="https://video-storyteller-dev.web.app">https://video-storyteller-dev.web.app</a> and registering with a google account.</p>
